观迎大家来填加啊

1. What is the connection between cognition and neuroscience? Is there a linking hypothesis missing?
2. Is deep learning the new neuroimaging? Is there something else, in addition to better fits and better prediction?
3. Where is the number/symbol or the concept in neural networks, artificial and biological?
4. What is an explanation of a function or a task? When can we say 'That's it. We have solved it.' 
5. Where is memory? Is it in the connections in neural networks? 
6. Why do artificial networks learn tricks slowly? What is a biological-plausible learning scheme?
7. What is the next-generation neural networks? DNN can't be the end. 
8. Can intelligence develope from scratch? Can we grow an artificial brain by simply setting up a training algorithm and a harsh environment and asking an agent to achieve a universal goal?
9. What is intelligence? Is the human intelligence THE intelligence? Or, we are narrow-minded and, by focusing on ourselves, we ignore the big picture of intelligence.
